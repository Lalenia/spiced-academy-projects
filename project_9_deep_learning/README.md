For this project a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) was builed to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

I trained the neural network with Keras. 

In the process on learning how artificial neural networks are working, i experimented with other neural networks architectures as well as 
as with Neural Style Transfer an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image 
(such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style 
reference image!
