# PyTorch Speech Recognition Challenge

### Kaggle challenge. 

In this project i tried to build an algorithm that can understand simple speech commands. Worked with PyTorch and Google Colab and builded object oriented Neural Networks.

##### Notes
At my last project i decided to learn PyTorch and build object oriented Neural Networks. Moreover i wanted to work with sound data, which in comparison with
image data, that iâ€™ve worked in an  earlier week of the bootcamp, has many more features to take in consideration -especially other data augmentation and feature engineering technics to apply- before giving them as an input to the model. I therefore decided to take the challenge of Kaggle on simple speech commands recognition and try in one week to build something very close to the original goal.
